# Women Techmakers

The website for Googleâ€™s **Women Techmakers** conferences.


## Project Notes

### Requirements

- SASS compiler

There is a `config.rb` Compass configuration file in the root. You have two choices:

- Run `compass watch` from the command line.
- Use an app like CodeKit to process changes (and refresh the browser). (This is how the site was developed. Using another option may require additional configuration.)
